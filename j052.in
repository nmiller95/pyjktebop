# Enter the appropriate numbers on the left-hand side of each line of this file.
# Most of the lines require two numerical parameters separated by spaces.       
  
# Put a negative number for the mass ratio to force the stars to be spherical.  
# The mass ratio will then be irrelevant (it is only used to get deformations). 
  
# To fit for rA and rB instead of (rA+rB) and k, give a negative value for r1+r2
# Then (rA+rB) will be interpreted to mean rA,  and k will be interpreted as rB.
# The adjustment indicators will similarly refer to rA,rB rather than (rA+rB),k.
  
# If e < 10 then e and omega will be assumed to be e*cos(omega) and e*sin(omega)
# If e >= 10 then e and omega will be assumed to be (e+10) and omega (degrees). 
# The first option is in general better unless eccentricity is larger or fixed. 
  
# The possible entries for the type of limb darkening law are 'lin' (for linear)
# 'log' (logarithmic), 'sqrt' (square-root), 'quad' (quadratic) or 'cub' (cubic)
# Put 'same' for star B to force its coefficients to be equal those of star A.  
  
# For each adjustable parameter the adjustment integer can be 0  (parameter will
# be fixed at the input file value),  1 (parameter will be freely adjusted),  2 
# (parameter will be fixed for initial fit but perturbed during later analysis).
# or  3 (adjusted in initial fit but not perturbed during Monte Carlo analysis).
  
# When fitting a light curve  the reflection coefficients can be calculated from
# the system geometry  (put -1 for the adjustment integers),  held fixed (put 0)
# or freely adjusted to fit the light curve (put 1) - useful for close binaries.
  
# FOUR-PARAMETER LIMB DARKENING:   you can alternatively put '4par' for the limb
# darkening in which case the input file format differs a bit. Change the lines:
#                   LD star A (linear coeff)   LD star B (linear coeff)         
#                   LD star A (nonlin coeff)   LD star B (nonlin coeff)         
# to the following lines and put in the information at the line starts as usual:
#                   LD star A (coefficient 1) LD star B (coefficient 1)         
#                   LD star A (coefficient 2) LD star B (coefficient 2)         
#                   LD star A (coefficient 3) LD star B (coefficient 3)         
#                   LD star A (coefficient 4) LD star B (coefficient 4)         
# You also need to change the lines for the adjustment parameters from:         
#                   Adjust LD-lin1  or  LD-lin2            (0, 1, 2, 3)

# to the following lines and put in the information at the line starts as usual:
#                   Adjust LDcoeff-A1 or LDcoeff-B1        (0, 1, 2, 3)         
#                   Adjust LDcoeff-A2 or LDcoeff-B2        (0, 1, 2, 3)

# TIMES OF MINIMUM LIGHT: add a line below the parameter line to input each one:
#   'TMIN  [cycle]  [time]  [error]'                                            
# where [cycle] is cycle number (integer for primary minimum  or integer+0.5 for
# secondary minimum), [time] and [error] are the observed time and uncertainty. 
  
# LIGHT RATIO: add a line below the parameter line to input each observed one:  
#   'LRAT'  [time]  [light_ratio]  [error]                                      
# where [time] is the time(HJD) when the spectroscopic light ratio was measured,
# [light_ratio] is its value and [error] is its measurement uncertainty.        
  
# MEASURED THIRD LIGHT VALUE:   include as observed constraint by adding a line:
# 'THDL'  [value]  [uncertainty]        
# which gives the third light measurement and its observational uncertainty.    
  
# MEASURED orbital shape parameters (depending on the value of eccentricity):   
#  ECSW  [value]  [uncertainty]    (interpreted as either e*cos(omega) or e)    
#  ENSW  [value]  [uncertainty]    (interpreted as either e*sin(omega) or omega)
  
# SINE AND POLYNOMIAL FITTING:   the parameters of sine curves or polynomials of
# order 5) can be included.  You can have up to nine sines and five polynomials,
# each acting on a specific parameter. The information for each one is specified
# by an additional line below the main input file parameters.     Line format:  
#   SINE  [par]  [T0]  [P]  [amp]  [vary(T0)]  [vary(P)]  [vary(amp)]           
#   POLY  [par]  [pivot]  [const]  [x]  [x^2]  [x^3] [x^4]  [x^5]  [vary(const)]  [vary(x)]  [vary(x^2)]  [vary(x^3)]   [vary(x^4)]   [vary(x^5)]               
# where the required parameters are given inside square brackets. [T0] is a time
# of zero phase (HJD), [P] is period (days), [amp] is amplitude, and [x^n] are  
# the coefficients of the polynomial.  Each parameter has a [vary()] which is 0,
# 1, 2 or 3 to indicate how the parameter is treated.                           
# [par] indicates what parameter to apply it to: J r1 r2 i L3 sf L1 L2 e w ec ew
# where sf indicates scale factor, L1 indicates the light from star A, L2 indic-
# ates the light from star B, ec indicates ecosw and es indicates esinw.        
# Note that the independent parameter is always time (either HJD or phase).     
# If you want to apply a polynomial to only part of the data, in a specific time
# interval, then use the following line           to give the extra information:
#   POLY  [par]  [pivot]  [const] [x] [x^2] [x^3] [x^4] [x^5]  [vary(const)] [vary(x)] [vary(x^2)] [vary(x^3)] [vary(x^4)] [vary(x^5)]  [start-time]  [end-time]
# JKTEBOP will check for the two extra numbers and use them automatically.      
  
# NUMERICAL INTEGRATION:  long exposure times can be split up into NUMINT points
# occupying a total time interval of NINTERVAL (seconds) by including this line:
#   NUMI  [numint]  [ninterval]                                                 
  
# FITTING FOR RADIAL VELOCITIES:    the observed RVs should be in separate files
# for the two stars and the data should be in the same format as the light curve
# data. Then add a line below the main input parameters for each RV file:       
#   RV1  [infile]  [outfile]  [K]  [Vsys]  [vary(K)]  [vary(Vsys)]              
#   RV2  [infile]  [outfile]  [K]  [Vsys]  [vary(K)]  [vary(Vsys)]              
# where RV1 is for primary star velocities, RV2 is for secondary star velocities
# [infile] is the input data file, [outfile] is the output data file, [K] is the
# velocity amplitude of the star (km/s), [Vsys] is its systemic velocity (km/s),
# and [vary(K)] and [vary(Vsys)] are 0 to fix and 1 to fit for these quantities.
# The mass ratio parameter is not used for the RVs, only for the light curve.   
# If you want to fix the systemic velocity for star B to that for star A, simply
# set vary(Vsys) for star B to be equal to -1                                   
  
# ERROR BARS IN THE DATAFILES: whenever JKTEBOP reads in a set of data from file
# it checks to see if there are three numbers on the first line.  If so, JKTEBOP
# assumes that the datafile contains three columns (TIME, OBSERVATION, ERRORBAR)
# and reads the data in accordingly. If it can only find two numbers, it assumes
# that these represent TIME, OBSERVATION  and that error bars are not available.
# If errorbars are not available, or if they are too large or too small, JKTEBOP
# can iteratively scale them until a reduced chi-squared of 1.0 is obtained.  To
# use this option put the word 'chif' ona line on its own below the main set of 
# parameters.  Warning: this is available only for light curves with ten or more
# datapoints and for RV curves with five or more datapoints. Be careful!
